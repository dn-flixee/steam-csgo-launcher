# Steam Launcher with Customization

This project is a C# application designed to help you launch Steam with a specific Steam ID. It was created before Steam introduced the multi-account switch option, providing an alternative method to launch Steam with different accounts.

## How to Use

To use this application, follow these steps:

1. Launch the application.
2. Provide the following information:
   - Steam Directory
   - Username
   - Password
3. Optional Customizations:
   - Launch Options for CSGO
   - Resolution settings
   - Windowed Mode preference

Once you've configured the necessary information and optional customizations, the application is ready to launch Steam with the specified settings.
